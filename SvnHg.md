**svnhg** is a commandline tool designed for migrating a repository from subversion to mercurial, without loosing your whole history.

This tool solves my "problem", any other tool I've tried was hard, complex or just doesn't work. Hey maybe you have one that works, but I haven't tried it.

The migration process is done by executing **svn** and **hg** comands in the following sequence

```
hg clone ...
svn checkout ...
svn update -r 1 ...
svn log -r 1 ...
hg add ...
hg commit ...
svn update -r 2 ...
svn log -r 2 ...
hg add ...
hg commit ...
...
```

I've just tried with my project softenido, so maybe it doesn't work with yours, just add an issue and it will be fixed in a near future.
