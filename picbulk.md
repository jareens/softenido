**picbulk** is a command-line tool designed to make easy a bulk upload of pics to picasaweb and alternatively send them by email.

There are multiple known bugs due it's under develompent, it has been a private program for 2 years (known as uploadpicasa) with no code for exceptions or errors, so it should be added. Now I've decided to release it to help those GNU/Linux users that hate the tedious task of uploading images to picasa.
