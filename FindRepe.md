**findrepe** is a command-line tool designed for an eficient search of repeated files. Basically the method consists in an initial comparison of file sizes, followed by an MD5 and SHA1 signature comparison (both must be satified to avoid MD5 or SHA1 collisions). There are some options to filter and an option to ask for deletion of repeated files. Zip and Jar files can be scanned recursively as regular files in read-only mode.

There are some known performance inefficiencies:

  * There is no MD5 and SHA1 signature cache for previously unchanged files (those with the same file size and modification time).

  * Reading from multiple devices could be parallelized to improve performance.

findrepe is been developed using Java and [NetBeans](http://www.netbeans.org) mostly in GNU/Linux (ubuntu 9.10 at this moment), and tested on Windows XP, Windows 7 and OpenSolaris.

There are some partial-implemented issues:
  * symlinks
  * cyclic loops
  * skip by default /dev and /proc /tmp and some others
  * comparator optimized for big files
  * "Actor Model" to achieve an scalable algorithm
  * concurrent optimizations
  * filter by filename
  * non-unicode filenames
  * scanning into zip, jar

There are some known non-implemented issues:

  * scanning into gzip, tgz and rar files
  * option for passing specific options to JVM, like -Xmx250m
  * hardlinks
  * make hardlinks or softlinks from duplicated files
  * changing files
  * reading file list from stdin or file
  * i18n (internationalization)
  * comparing images, audios and videos like humans
  * javadoc should be added
  * source code should be tested with findbugs, pdm, ...
  * ultrafast comparator assuming few KB are enough
  * GUI version
  * Web-GUI version (with HttpServer class) maybe option "--web 80"
  * exclude some control files of netbeans java projects
  * cache for files using javadb (derby) or smalSQL. canonicalpath+size+modification\_time
    * modes: off, aggressive, conservative
    * clean cache
    * countdown for cached hashes
    * autoclean cache
  * android edition

findrepe searches the given path for repeated files by content (not name). Such
files are found by comparing file sizes and MD5+SHA1 signatures.
